## ⚡ What I Do
I bridge the gap between the rigorous stability of traditional banking and the rapid innovation of AI-native, Web3-powered finance. With over a decade of experience designing resilient systems, I lead the technical vision at **Mintoria**, building the future of banking through Stablecoins and AI.

## 🎯 The Hook: Stability Meets Innovation
In fintech, you're usually forced to choose: the agility of a startup or the reliability of a bank. **I deliver both.**

I bring the engineering rigor of Scotiabank to the frontier of AI and Web3, ensuring your innovation is built on a foundation that won't crack under pressure. Whether it's migrating 13 legacy platforms to the cloud or architecting a secure, AI-driven banking platform from the ground up, I focus on one thing: **building software that lasts.**

## 📈 Impact & Proof
*   **Mintoria (Current):** Architecting a secure, AI-native banking platform that bridges traditional finance with Stablecoin liquidity. Leading infrastructure on Azure and secure blockchain integrations.
*   **Scotiabank:** Modernized 13 critical banking platforms, eliminating legacy bottlenecks and ensuring 99.9% uptime on Azure.
*   **BairesDev (LensLock):** Boosted system performance by 20% and slashed downtime by 30% through algorithmic optimization.
*   **Crisis Response:** Delivered loan moratorium support to **1,500+ clients** during the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring financial continuity in a global crisis.

## ⚙️ How I Work
I believe that **architecture is about trade-offs, not perfection.** My approach combines:
- **Pragmatic Innovation:** Using AI and Web3 to solve real business problems, not just for the hype.
- **Banking-Grade Security:** Applying zero-trust principles and rigorous testing to every line of code.
- **Scalable Foundations:** Designing systems that handle today's load while being ready for tomorrow's growth.
