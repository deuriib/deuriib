      # If you have a build step (e.g., compiling Sass, running a static site generator),
      # add it here. For a simple HTML/CSS, this step might not be strictly necessary
      # unless you want to put your source files in a subfolder and copy the output.
      # Example for building:
      # - name: Build static files
      #   run: |
      #     npm install # if you have a package.json for build tools
      #     npm run build # or your build command, which should output to a 'dist' or 'build' folder

          # If your index.html and style.css are directly in the root of 'main', use '.'
          # If they are in a folder like 'public' or 'dist', use 'public/' or 'dist/'
          path: . # This tells the action to package everything at the root of your repo
